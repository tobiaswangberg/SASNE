# SASNE - Shape Aware Stochastic Neighbor Embedding


### Introduction 

SASNE (Shape-aware stochastic neighbor embedding) is a method that can be used to create low dimensional visualisation that reveal key structures of high dimensional data.

For more information about SASNE and possible applications please refer to our [preprint](https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1831618/v1). 

The code method is currently implemented in MATLAB.

### Installation

To install SASNE input the following command to a terminal:

    git clone  https://github.com/tobiaswangberg/SASNE.git
    cd SASNE

### System requirements

The program requires a [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) installation (version >= 2019a).

### Help

If you have any general questions or need help with running the program please feel free to send a message to <tobias@math.su.se>.
